# Quarkus demo: Hibernate ORM with Panache and RESTEasy

[https://devspaces.apps.lab.pitt.ca/f?url=https://github.com/pittar-sandbox/quarkus-postgres&che-editor=https://github.com/pittar-sandbox/quarkus-postgres/blob/main/devfile-intellij.yaml](https://devspaces.apps.lab.pitt.ca/f?url=https://github.com/pittar-sandbox/quarkus-postgres&che-editor=https://github.com/pittar-sandbox/quarkus-postgres/blob/main/devfile-intellij.yaml)


This is a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST,
with a front-end based on Angular so you can play with it from your browser.

While the code is surprisingly simple, under the hood this is using:
 - RESTEasy to expose the REST endpoints
 - Hibernate ORM with Panache to perform the CRUD operations on the database
 - A PostgreSQL database; see below to run one via Docker
 - ArC, the CDI inspired dependency injection tool with zero overhead
 - The high performance Agroal connection pool
 - Infinispan based caching
 - All safely coordinated by the Narayana Transaction Manager

## Requirements

To compile and run this demo you will need:

- JDK 17+

In addition, you will need either a PostgreSQL database in "prod".  This demo uses H2 locally.

## Building the demo

Launch the Maven build on the checked out sources of this demo:

> mvn package

## Running the demo

### Live coding with Quarkus

The Maven Quarkus plugin provides a development mode that supports
live coding. To try this out:

> mvn quarkus:dev

In this mode you can make changes to the code and have the changes immediately applied, by just refreshing your browser.

    Hot reload works even when modifying your JPA entities.
    Try it! Even the database schema will be updated on the fly.
